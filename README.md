# NASA-Horizons
Pass object strings as args. Pass dates using `-d` or `--date`.

Example args: `301 Sun -d 01:01:2012 --date 06:04:2023 199 299 499 508 --date 06:04:2016 --date 06:04:1303`

These can be passed to `horizons`, `horizonpull`, and `horizonread`.

`horizonpull` will pull all combinations of dates and objects from NASA.

`horizonread` will parse all combinations of dates and objects from the files generated by `horizonpull`. IMPORTANT to run them in the same directory.

`horizons` will call `horizonpull` and `horizonread` with the same set of arguments.
